                <p>Welcome to my implementation of Bop-It! This whimsical little project was imagined and created over the course of 5-6 weeks, and carried out over remote learning with somewhat limited access to resources. A quick overview of the game is outlined below; feel free to take a look in the other sections of this website to get a more detailed look into its creation.</p>

				Next Steps:
				<br><br>
				The next steps for this project would first and foremost be the implementation of a 7-segment display; this was not part of the original game due to their exhaustive use of I/O pins on the microcontroller, which was not possible in this design. The 7-segment display would allow the user to see a countdown of time as well as a score after time has run out. Further steps would also include the communication and implementation of a peripheral Arduino board, in order to have extra hardware control pins, as well as more complex software implementations, and serial communication. A more powerful speaker, a twist-it function with spring action, and the ability to run off of an internal power source are other next steps I would like to implement with more time and resources.
